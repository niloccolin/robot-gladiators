# robot-gladiators

Create a new GitHub repository, an issue, and branches. These are
the basic steps for any new project.

Create project files and structure. We'll set up the index.html
and game.js file structure according to the Con Solo instructions.

Use JavaScript functions to display the game status to the
player. JavaScript has some built-in functions that do this, and
we'll also create our own functions to control when these messages
appear.

Use JavaScript variables and operators to manage game data. We're
going to do a little math and keep track of robot health, player
money, and other game values.

Make decisions using JavaScript conditions. For example, the game
should allow a robot to fight if it still has health points, but
not if its health points reach 0.

Allow the user to decide whether they would like to fight or skip
the fight.



build process for this lesson:

Pseudocode the game logic. 

Add combatants to the battle using arrays.

Fight enemy robot combatants using for loops.

Fight each combatant using function arguments.

Battle the combatants until defeated using a while loop.

Improve the user's game experience.
